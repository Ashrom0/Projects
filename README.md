# Projects
## This repository is designed to show several projects that display coding knowledge, ability, and understanding.
# **Full Inheritance**
Full Inheritance is a project that I worked on in school. This program is designed to test your ability to apply core coding principals focusing on Polymorphism and inheritance. 

I choose to display this project on my GitHub because it shows my understanding of polymorphism, and inheritance.
It displays my coding style and shows my level of ability to incorporate a wide array of coding tools and classes.

# **C Coding Final**

I see this final as a comprehensive test of all of my C coding knowledge. Many topics were incorporated into a cohesive lab.
Tools used:
*Struct
*Dynamic arrays
*Sorting
*File utils

A key goal of the lab is to create the foundation of an object in C. C is the foundation of all programming languages, it does not strictly
have Objects but you can arrive at something similar with clever use of Struct.
